Known Bugs: change in background only updates after another command is executed on the turtle, commands do not 
run after language change

Simplifications:
Missing -  all shape functionality; getPenColor, setPalette, get/setShape, get/setPenSize, askWith commands; 
multiple workspace functionality, loading/saving files, recursion, activating/deactivating turtles via view
